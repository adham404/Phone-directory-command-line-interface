# ProjectProgramming1
Final project for Programming 1 University course.

## Description
At the end of our programming 1 course at the University we were assigned a final project where we were required to write a command line interface for a phone directory.

### Notes
If this is the first time to run the code on your device then you will not be able to load the directory as it will be non existent you will be required to first create one and add entries to it.
